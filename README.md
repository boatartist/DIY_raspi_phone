# DIY_raspi_phone
This is a project I've been working on for a while, inspired by other projects online, like OURS phone and the tutorial on Core Electronics
Made using some parts I had (Raspberry Pi and screen), and the most compatible parts I could find online (4G hat and mini keyboard). 
This is my first time properly uploading a project to a github repo so I hope I'm doing this right. 
The main code file is flask_sms.py, which I access on my raspberry pi from a command, so it's basically an app. On my raspberry pi all the files are found in the Desktop, with sms_flask being a sub-folder on the desktop. If you want to change this, just change the file paths in flask_sms.py.
I'll attach .stls for the case, which isn't amazing but it does have a hinge that I'm very proud of.
There's some setup involved with linking the 4G hat's serial connection, and i'm not 100% sure that it's the same for everyone, i've done a LOT of googling, but I'll put my process in at some point.


This is what the phone looks like
