These three files are the .stls for the case
There's the main unit, which the Raspberry Pi and all hats slide into (no cables connected) (there's some wiggling involved for camera/antenna cable)
Then slide the door in place and put cables in and screw in antenna
Then slide the keyboard into its case and wedge it onto the hinges
Et voila, you magically have a mediocre flip-phone case
Super portable and definitely an improvement
